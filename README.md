# Fake-News-Sensing

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of identifying and classifying news articles as either fake or genuine. Given the potential negative impact of misinformation on society, our project aims to develop a robust model to differentiate between authentic and fabricated news. We employ four different machine learning techniques to achieve accurate results:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Problem Statement

In the digital age, the rapid spread of information on various online platforms has made it increasingly important to identify fake news. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to automatically assess the credibility of news articles, helping to combat the spread of misinformation.

## Dataset

We use a labeled dataset comprising news articles categorized as either true or false. The dataset is split into two classes:

- **True:** Articles that are verified as genuine.
- **False:** Articles identified as fake or misleading.

## System Requirements

### Hardware:

- 4GB RAM
- i3 Processor
- 500MB free disk space
